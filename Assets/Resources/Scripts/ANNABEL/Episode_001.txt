*NARRATOR
It's a beautiful morning so you decide to take a stroll through the flower garden in the front of RavenHeart Hospital.


Bees and other insects buzz and flutter around the colorful flowers and vegetation. The way the garden dances and sways in the cool breeze relaxes you.


The peaceful silence is broken as a puppy runs past you and out of sight into the garden’s bushes. A familiar face comes up the path, panting from exhaustion.


*ANNABEL, 2
MR. PEANUTBUTTER! MR. PEANUTBUTTER!! COME BACK! 


Hey, PROTAG… Did you… see… a pomeranian… come this way?

Oh, no… It’s going to take forever to find ‘em! Can you help me catch him?

That puppy is scheduled to have surgery this afternoon but escaped during transport. Can you help me catch him?

                *ANNABEL
Great. We need to figure out a strategy to catch this doggo so we can help him. Any ideas?

                I’m kind of busy...


*ANNABEL
Are you serious!? You know that you are scheduled to perform the operation on this puppy, right?


*PROTAG
I guess I forgot…


*ANNABEL
It sounds like you got no choice but to help me, so do you have any ideas on how we can catch him?

                Let’s stick together. Strength in numbers.


                *ANNABEL
                Sounds like a solid plan.

                *PROTAG, leave
                *ANNABEL, leave


*NARRATOR
You, Annabel and Edgar start walking through the well-manicured flora. After ten minutes of searching high and low, you find tracks left behind, but Mr. Peanutbutter remains elusive.
                
                *ANNABEL, 2
The pupperino is nowhere to be found… Perhaps we should try another plan?


*PROTAG, 4
Alright, let’s split up.

*ANNABEL
I’ll check over here and you go over there. If you find Mr. PB, don’t scare ‘em, just try to lead him towards the center and we’ll catch ‘em for sure.


*PROTAG
Sounds good.


*ANNABEL, leave


*NARRATOR
You and Annabel split up and start walking through the garden. After a few minutes you hear Annabel shout out to you.


“Hey! PROTAG! I found him and he’s coming your way! Get ready!”

                *NARRATOR
You bend your knees and get into a wide, defensive stance, ready to grab the puppy at  a moment’s notice. 


You hear the rustling of leaves, the soft pitter-patter of little paws and the excited panting of a good boy approach.


And then suddenly…


A fluffy puppy jumps out!


You grab the puppy and cuddle it in your arms. It licks your face enthusiastically. Annabel follows closely behind.

Amazing! You’re a natural.

                *NARRATOR
You crouch behind the largest fern and poise yourself.


You hear the rustling of leaves, the soft pitter-patter of little paws and the excited panting of a good boy approach.


And then suddenly…


A fluffy puppy jumps out!


You brace yourself and then jump out to grab Mr. Peanutbutter. It easy slips out of reach as you fall face first into the ground.


As you get up and brush yourself off and see Annabel holding the puppy in her arms.


*ANNABEL, 2
Sleeping on the job?


*PROTAG
I’m not quite ready for a dirt nap.

You get down on all fours and wiggle your hips as if you had a tail.


You hear the rustling of leaves, the soft pitter-patter of little paws and the excited panting of a good boy approach.


And then suddenly…


A fluffy puppy jumps out and pounces on you, covering your face with wet kisses.

What’s wrong with the puppy? He seems perfectly fine.

I’ll explain in pre-op. Let’s get Mr. Peanutbutter to the OR right away!

*PREOP

*BGM: pre-op
*VICTIMS: 1


*PROTAG, 4
So what’s the situation?


*ANNABEL, 2
Our patient today is Mr. Peanutbutter, a one year old pomeranian. 


Mr. Peanutbutter was brought in for swallowing some BUILDO BRICKS this morning. He’s simply too small to pass them so we will need to perform surgery to remove them.


*PROTAG
I guess that explains why Mr. Peanutbutter seemed perfectly healthy this morning.


*EDGAR
<SCREECH!>


*ANNABEL
Yes, Edgar, thankfully he isn’t in any pain, but this will cause discomfort and eventually lead to serious problems pretty quickly, as you can imagine.


*PROTAG
Understood. Let’s work quickly. Prepare anesthesia and the safety checklist!

It appears that the BUILDO BRICKS have caused a few cuts. Let’s make sure to clear those up after removing the bricks.

        *PET_MICROCHIP


        *ANNABEL
Before we finish up, we should install a Pet Microchip into Mr. Peanutbutter as standard procedure.


*PROTAG
Standard procedure? What does the microchip do?


*ANNABEL
The Pet Microchips act as an ID for pets in case they get lost. It became standard veterinary practice several years back, although ours are a bit more advanced.


*PROTAG
How so?


*ANNABEL
Our microchips provide an ID for the owner of the pet as well as monitor the pet’s vitals to help with routine check ups. 


While it's a little more involved than a basic microchipping procedure, it helps a lot in the long run. I even got Edgar chipped!


*PROTAG
I’m sure he appreciates it.

Good work, PROTAG! Hopefully Mr. Peanutbutter will only eat doggie food from now on.

What do you like most about being a Veterinarian?


                *ANNABEL
I just love animals and it's the best job for me to directly help animals that need urgent care.


*ACTION_CHOICE

        *PROTAG
        What’s the most challenging part of the job?


        *ANNABEL
Well, emotionally, it's definitely difficult to see injured animals and when you lose a patient. I’m sure any other surgeon would relate to that.


Mechanically speaking, it's challenging since the anatomy of each animal is different and each animal requires different treatments and medications.


*PROTAG
Makes sense to me.
*END_CHOICE
        *CHOICE
*PROTAG
It must be difficult seeing so many injured and sick animals every day.


*ANNABEL
It is difficult but I know these things happen regardless if I see it happen in person or not. 


If these terrible things are going to happen, I want to do something about it. It’s our responsibility not to ignore the challenging parts of life: we gotta face it head on!


*PROTAG
That’s… deep.


*ANNABEL
Haha, sorry. You asked a pretty deep question.

What is your favorite kind of food?


*LOVE: 1


*ANNABEL
Hmm… Probably my mother’s vegetable biryani. Or maybe her tandoori paneer tikka… She’s an excellent cook: very thorough.


She makes her own sauces, mixes her own spices, grows most of the vegetables in her own garden. It's kind of intimidating. I would describe the food as intense to prepare as is the spicy flavor.


*ACTION_CHOICE
        *CHOICE
                *PROTAG
                Did you learn to cook from her?


                *ANNABEL
I tried for a long time, but I couldn’t keep up. She’s pretty particular about each step of the process and I couldn’t handle that.


*PROTAG
(Yikes!)
        *END_CHOICE
        *CHOICE
                *PROTAG
                Sounds delicious.


                *ANNABEL
Yep. The sauces are so spicy she might as well put hot lava on your plate. If you can get past that, it's delicious.


Thinking about this is making me hungry: good thing we’re almost there!

What is your favorite hobby?

I enjoy painting. I don’t think I’m very good at it but it's nice to paint landscapes or city skylines. I find it relaxing.


Do you have any artistic skills or hobbies?
