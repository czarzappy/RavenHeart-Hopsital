*BGM: chill_evening

*NARRATOR
You approach a young man standing in front of a sleek and modern ambulance, nothing like the big, box-shaped wagons you are familiar with.

There is a holographic flame decal that runs along the front and sides of the ambulance. “The Inferno” is emblazoned on the hood. It’s like something out of a cheesy action movie.

*DANTE, 4
Are you ready, rookie? Clock’s tickin’.

*PROTAG, 2

*PROTAG, concerned
I think so.

*DANTE, grumpy
Well, wake up scrub! This is the real deal.
*END_CHOICE
	*CHOICE
*PROTAG, serious
I was born ready.
*LOVE: 2

*DANTE, happy
That’s what I’m talkin’ about!

*PROTAG, snarky
Are you ready?

*DANTE, unimpressed
I bet you thought that sounded cool in your head.

*PROTAG
Semper Paratus.
*LOVE: 1

*DANTE, laughing
This ain’t the Coast Guard, but I suppose close enough: we’re in the business of saving lives.

*NARRATOR
Dante pats the top of the Inferno lovingly and climbs inside. You get into the passenger seat and lock into the seatbelt harness. It feels like strapping into a race car.

*DANTE, intrigued
Holiday was making a big fuss over the new recruit. So let’s see whatcha’ got!

*NARRATOR
Dante presses several buttons and the console display of the vehicle lights up. 

*DANTE
Before we leave, I have a very important question to ask: what kind of tunes are we rolling with?

*ACTION_CHOICE
	*CHOICE
		*PROTAG, calm
		Lofi hip hop beats to study and/or relax to.

		*DANTE, angry
Really? How am I supposed to drive fast to chill beats to study and/or relax?

*NARRATOR
Dante hits the play button on the console and you begin to vibe.

*BGM: chill_vaporwave
	*END_CHOICE
	*CHOICE
		*PROTAG, happy
		Something cheerful.

		*DANTE, curious
		I think I got something for you…

		*NARRATOR
Dante hits the play button on the console. For some reason it reminds you of Annabel…

BGM: hospital
	*END_CHOICE
	*CHOICE
		*PROTAG, thoughtful
		Do you have any blues or country?

		*NARRATOR
		Dante raises an eyebrow.

		*DANTE, unamused
		If you insist. I’m picking next time, though.

	*BGM: bigtex

		*NARRATOR
Dante hits the play button on the console. For some reason it reminds you of Big Tex...
	*END_CHOICE
	*CHOICE
		*PROTAG, happy
		Something fast, obviously.

		*LOVE: 1

		*NARRATOR
Dante smirks as he hits the play button on the console. 

*BGM: emergency

Your heart jolts as the sudden volume of sound hits your ears. The lights on the dashboard pulse with the techno groove.

*NARRATOR
Dante pulls the stick shift into gear, and peels out of the Hospital’s garage. A hologram of a 3D map of the city appears on the dashboard with the route highlighted with a glowing line.

He reaches up to grab a radio microphone, clicks the button in with his thumb and begins talking to you, even though you are only several inches apart.

*DANTE
Alright, rookie, here’s the situation. There’s been a fight at “The Crow’s Nest,” a local bar. Some say that place is haunted. Or cursed. Maybe both… 

*ACTION_CHOICE
	*CHOICE
		*PROTAG
Haunted?

		*PROTAG
		Like, ghosts haunted?

		*DANTE
It's old and run down so it could just be squeaky floorboards. But it might be more. Fun to think about, right?
	*END_CHOICE
	*CHOICE
		*PROTAG
		Cursed?

		*DANTE
Its old and a lot of bad stuff has gone down there so I think that qualifies as cursed, if you ask me.
	*END_CHOICE
*END_ACTION_CHOICE

Anyway, two victims have been identified for us to handle, but there could be more. You never know with things like this, there may be others who got hurt. It was a bar fight, after all.

Expect broken glass. Lacerations. Probably broken bones. We’ll see soon enough, so keep your eyes peeled.

*NARRATOR
Dante fluidly adjusts gears while driving at breakneck speed, weaving between cars and trucks on the busy city streets. Dante steals a glance your way amidst the chaos of the road.

*DANTE
You look like you got something on your mind. What’s up?

*ACTION_CHOICE
	*CHOICE
		*PROTAG
		Do you always drive this reckless?

		*NARRATOR
Dante turns to you seemingly bemused.

		*DANTE, coy
		Yep.
	*END_CHOICE
	*CHOICE
		*PROTAG, curious
Why was there a fight?

*DANTE
I dunno. The cops are on their way to deal with that. It's not really our problem. We don’t cuff ‘em, we fix ‘em. That’s it.

*NARRATOR
The wheels screech as Dante slams on the breaks.

*DANTE
Alright, we’re here.

*CUTSCENE
*BGM: dante_hangout
*BG: charmcity_crowsnest

*NARRATOR
You follow Dante as he enters the bar. A restless crowd gathered around the entrance, lit by a neon light. Dante raises his voice over the commotion and pushes his way through.

*DANTE, 4, angry
Outta the way! Paramedics coming through! 

*DANTE, confused
Rookie? Where the hell are you?

*PROTAG, 2
*ACTION_CHOICE
	*CHOICE
*PROTAG
Push through the crowd.

*NARRATOR
You push your way through the crowd in an attempt to catch up with Dante and bump into a major beefcake. They do not seem to notice, but are blocking your way.
	*END_CHOICE
	*CHOICE
		*PROTAG
		Look for an opening.

		*NARRATOR
You look for a break in the crowd to slip by. The crowd keeps shuffling making it hard to find an opening.

*LOVE: -1

*DANTE, angry
Umm, hello? We gotta job to do here!

*NARRATOR
At Dante’s urging, you start to push through the crowd and bump into a major beefcake. They do not seem to notice, but are blocking your way.

*ACTION_CHOICE
	*CHOICE
		*PROTAG, scared
Excuse me. I need to get through.

*NARRATOR
The imposing figure does not seem to hear you. Suddenly an arm reaches out of the crowd and grabs onto your lapel and pulls you forward.

*DANTE, angry
What the hell are you doing? We got to get working and fast!
*LOVE: -1

*NARRATOR
Dante returns to two men lying on the ground. They appear to be bleeding.
	*END_CHOICE
*CHOICE
		*PROTAG, angry
Move it or lose it pal!

*NARRATOR
The imposing figure slowly turns towards you, eyes bulging in anger. They notice your medical gear and step aside, eyes locked onto you.

You approach Dante who is kneeling next to two men lying on the ground. They appear to be bleeding.

*BGM: pre-op
*VICTIMS: 2?

*PROTAG, 2

*DANTE, 4
Looks like these two chuckleheads decided to try out for MMA after putting back a few too many.

One has a broken arm and both are suffering from lacerations. Broken glass is embedded in their arms.

Let’s patch ‘em up quick and bring them back to the hospital for further treatment.
