*NARRATOR
While strolling through the hallway, your holopad’s alarm goes off: you are needed in the Veterinary ER right away! 


You run quickly to the operating room, running into Annabel along the way.


*ANNABEL,4
PROTAG! I was just looking for you.


*PROTAG,2
What’s going on?


*ANNABEL
There was a big car collision this morning and a cat happened to be in the middle of it. No time to waste: meet me in pre-op and get ready to operate.


*ANNABEL, leave


*PROTAG
This doesn’t sound good.

*VICTIMS: 1


*PROTAG, 4
*ANNABEL, 2
Our patient today is Tardar Sauce, a mixed breed, 7-year old cat.


*NARRATOR
The little cat sits on the operating table. She has large, rather goofy eyes and a droopy mouth appearing as a big frown.


*PROTAG
She sure looks grumpy!


*ANNABEL
I mean you would be too if you were in the middle of a car accident, hon!


*EDGAR
<SCREECH!>


*ANNABEL
Yes, Edgar, we’re wasting time. Tardar Sauce is in critical condition, so we need to work quickly. 


Be sure to monitor her vitals closely during this operation, PROTAG.


*PROTAG
Understood. Let’s get started.

        *ANNABEL
        Alright, this area appears to be clear. Let’s move on.


        *EDGAR
        <SCREECH!>


        *PROTAG
        What’s wrong?


        *ANNABEL
        I-I think Tartar Sauce’s pulse is dropping!


        *PROTAG
Oh no! She’s going into cardiac arrest. Might be from shock.


        *ANNABEL
Doesn’t matter why right now. You need to use the Defibrillator, and fast!

*ANNABEL
X-rays show that the leg sustained serious injuries and was broken. 


If it was any worse, we may have needed to perform an amputation, but we can repair it.


//future mechanic: fabricate new bones


*PROTAG
First thing’s first: we gotta remove the foreign objects before surgery.
*END_PHASE
*PHASE
*SCALPEL


*ANNABEL
We’ll need to open up the leg, replace the shattered bone and then put the leg into a cast.

*BROKEN_CAT_LEG


        *ANNABEL
        Be sure to clean up the blood pools as you repair the leg.


        *EDGAR
        <SCREECH!>


        *ANNABEL
        No, sorry, Edgar, you cannot help. You don’t have hands, hon.


        *EDGAR
        <cawww…>
*END_PHASE

        *PROTAG
        Let’s sew up the leg and put it in a cast.
