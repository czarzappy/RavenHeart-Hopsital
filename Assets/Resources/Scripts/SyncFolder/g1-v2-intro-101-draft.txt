*NARRATOR
Ravenheart Hospital, Charm City


Regarded as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, hospitals in the world.


As you walk up the steps, you are taken aback by the hospital’s magnificence.


The tall columns bring to mind the importance of the medical profession and those who came before you.


Your small reflection in the large glass windows remind you that you are but one of many who help save lives every day.


You know deep down that a hospital is a place of healing, but its appearance and legacy are still intimidating...


Especially for your first day on the job.


A woman approaches you with a swift stride.


*HOLIDAY, 4
Welcome to Ravenheart Hospital.


I’m Dr. Holiday, the Director of Operations here at Ravenheart.
And you are?


//Character creator


*PROTAG, 2
I’m PROTAG.


*HOLIDAY, smiling
Ah, so you are the new recruit.
Good to meet you, PROTAG.


*NARRATOR
Dr. Holiday extends her hand.

<Light handshake>


*NARRATOR
Your hand is like a wet pinata in the director’s firm, yet controlled, grip.


*HOLIDAY, unimpressed
We have a few formalities to cover before you begin working with patients.

<Firm handshake>


*NARRATOR
You do your best to shake the director’s hand firmly, but not too hard.


Her hands are surprisingly strong and tough, and her handshake is firm and controlled. 


*HOLIDAY, neutral
We have a few formalities to cover before you begin working with patients.

                *NARRATOR
                You salute Dr. Holiday and stand at attention.
                
                Dr. Holiday rolls her eyes.


                *HOLIDAY, unimpressed
At ease, soldier. We have a few formalities to cover before you begin working with patients.

*NARRATOR
Her steady gaze meets yours. 


*HOLIDAY
Why did you decide to become a Doctor?


*ACTION_CHOICE
        *CHOICE
                *PROTAG, calm
To help people.


*NARRATOR
Dr. Holiday closes her eyes and nods in agreement.


*PROTAG
No matter what happens in the world, we’ll always have injuries and sickness. Nurses and Doctors will always be needed.


When you are in the operating room, the patient’s life is in your hands. It's a big responsibility. I want to do my part.
        *END_CHOICE
*CHOICE
        *PROTAG, neutral
        The challenge.


        *HOLIDAY, curious
        Oh? Do tell.


*PROTAG, serious
The human body is a complex, living machine. You have to work quickly and accurately not just to heal but also to avoid harm. Careless mistakes can kill.


*HOLIDAY
You sound like an engineer. Don’t forget that these patients are people and require an open heart as well as a calculated mind. 
*END_CHOICE
*CHOICE
        *PROTAG, laughing
                The paycheck!


                *HOLIDAY, angry
I’d suggest stand up comedy for a career, except you aren’t funny.


                *PROTAG, nervous
                What’s wrong with wanting to make a comfortable living? 


                *HOLIDAY, neutral
Nothing. Honestly, I don’t care what your motives are. I want the best talent and I expect results. 


I expect you to do the work quickly and effectively. I can live with a transactional working relationship, but your co-workers might not be as open minded as I am.
        *END_CHOICE
*END_ACTION_CHOICE


*HOLIDAY
Pardon the monotony of formalities.


*NARRATOR
Dr. Holiday hits a few buttons on her holopad and a holo-projection of your working agreement and contract appears.


*NARRATOR
You fill out the holo-projection with all your important legal information and get your hand scanned for access to the building.


When you finish up the work, an ID with your name, picture and other details pops out of a little slot on the bottom of the holopad.


Dr. Holiday hands it to you and you attach it to your coat.


*HOLIDAY
I have high expectations of you, PROTAG.
Are you ready for your first operation?

//EPISODE 1-2: PRE-OP
*PREOP
*BG: hospital_operatingroom
*BGM: pre-op
*VICTIMS: 1


*PROTAG, 2
*HOLIDAY, 4
Our patient today is Frank Smith. He is suffering from stomach tumors which will need to be excised and sterilized. 


PROTAG, you will be leading this operation. I will monitor your work and will step in if necessary. 


Removing these tumors is a fairly simple procedure. First, sterilize the area to prevent infection, cut around the tumor and remove it. Patch it with a BANDAGE and seal it with MEDIGEL. 


Any questions before we get started?


*ACTION_CHOICE:4
        *CHOICE
                *PROTAG
                Does the patient have any other underlying conditions?


                *HOLIDAY
We checked and it doesn’t appear that he has any other conditions that would affect this operation. 


Any other questions before we get started?
        *END_CHOICE
*CHOICE
*PROTAG, curious
Do we know if the tumors are malignant?


*HOLIDAY
We ran several diagnostic tests and fortunately it appears that they are benign. 


*PROTAG
Better safe than sorry, I suppose.


*HOLIDAY
Any other questions before we get started?
        *END_CHOICE
*CHOICE
*PROTAG
What’s MEDIGEL?


*HOLIDAY
It's a new bio-tech tool being developed here at RavenHeart. It acts as a disinfectant as well as a synthetic membrane which promotes cell growth.


Think of it like first aid glue. It can heal small wounds instantly and can be used to secure synthetic bandages. It’s pretty amazing.


*PROTAG
Wow. I wonder what else is being developed here…


*HOLIDAY
You’ll find out soon enough, but right now I want you to be focused on the operation.


Any other questions before we get started?
        *END_CHOICE
        *CHOICE
                *PROTAG
                No, I’m ready, Dr. Holiday.


                *BREAK
        *END_CHOICE

*HOLIDAY
Good. Prepare the safety checklist and scrub up for the OR.

        *PROTAG
We’re fortunate that these tumors are benign since they have grown to be quite large.


        *HOLIDAY, distressed
I must admit these tumors look much larger in person than on the X-Rays.

Good work, PROTAG. All the tumors have been safely removed.
