*BGM: dante_hangout


*NARRATOR
Dante speeds through the city.


*DANTE, 3
There’s been a collision involving multiple cars and a moving truck. It’s an absolute mess. No word on the number of wounded.


*DANTE, leave


*NARRATOR
At first you see the smoke. Soon after, the wreckage.


Dante pulls the clutch, turns the steering wheel sharply and slams on the breaks, drifting into a screeching stop.


*DANTE,5
*PROTAG, 1


*NARRATOR
The two of you get out and you are caught up in the image of the flipped vehicles. 


Thankfully the Fire Department has already arrived and pulled victims from the wreckage. They are currently working to put out the fires.


Dante begins quickly pulling supplies out of the trunk of the Inferno. He looks over his shoulder while his hands continue to work.


*DANTE
What are you doin’ just standing there? Gimme a hand.


*PROTAG, 4


*NARRATOR
You rush over to Dante’s side to help him with the supplies.

                *NARRATOR
You pick up the little electronic box. It’s surprisingly light.


                *DANTE
I don’t think we need that, but if you wanna carry it be my guest. 


*PROTAG
You can never be too careful, right?


*DANTE
I want YOU to be careful with it. You break it, you buy it.

                *NARRATOR
You grab the suture kit that contains specialized forceps and biologically absorbable sutures.


*LOVE:1


*DANTE
Good thinking. Those will come in handy if we have any lacerations.

                *NARRATOR
You grab the can of Bull Rush XTREME!! N-R-G that has clearly been sitting in the trunk forgotten for months.


                *DANTE
What the heck, that’s my lunch right there! Hands off, pal!


*ACTION_CHOICE
        *CHOICE
                *PROTAG
You should really consider a balanced meal for lunch. Perhaps some herbal green tea as well?

What in the heck are you talkin’ about? 


*LOVE:1


*NARRATOR
Dante tries to hide his cheeks blushing and mutters under his breath.

*VICTIMS: 1


*PROTAG, 3
*DANTE, 5
The Fire Department is going to handle the fire and remove the debris from the vehicles. 


Our job is to patch up the wounded and stabilize them so they survive the trip to the hospital.


*DANTE
Quiz time, rookie! What fun’s in store for us today? What kind of injuries should we expect to see from a car collision?


*PROTAG, thinking
Lacerations, bone fractures, whiplash, potentially internal bleeding, post-traumatic stress...


*DANTE
Well, we can’t fix that last one, but we can try to help with the others, right?


*PROTAG
I suppose you are right.


Let’s get to it.

Don’t worry about it. Just try to stay still.
